# Workshop-8 

https://amiarr.github.io/Workshop-8/ 

For this workshop I selected an API from the list and chose one that produced a picture of a random fox. My first initial attempts at using this API following the tutorial didn't work, so I used ChatGPT to help rewrite the code so that it did work. I could have experimented with more APIs, since I was largely reliant on ChatGPT to make it work, which would have helped me learn more from the tutorial.
